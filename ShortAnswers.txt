Q1:
Both readers and the post author would be harmed, as this bug can alter the idea of the text and to some it could be offensive.
also with wrong translation some words might become insulting which could be a real problem.
Q2:
I'd use some online help asking native speakers to give me the snippets of different texts and with that program would be
easily adjusted.
Q3:
Some nieche languages and dialect speakers would be negatively impacted and via feedback I'd assess their impact.

Brick by brick, and I be damned if I let you tear it down just cause you don't like the way another nice gentleman talk.
please invest some more
Q5:
